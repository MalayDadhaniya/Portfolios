        <p>
          &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Iâ€™m a dedicated <b>web developer</b>{" "}
          based in <b>Rajkot, India</b>, currently in my final year of a B.Sc.
          in IT. With a broad skill set across both <b>frontend</b> and{" "}
          <b>backend development</b>, including JavaScript, React, and PHP, I
          approach every project with curiosity and a drive to deliver quality
          results. My internships in React and PHP have deepened my practical
          knowledge, enabling me to create responsive and dynamic applications.
          Outside of my technical pursuits, I enjoy <b>cricket</b> and
          <b> drawing</b>, which keep my creativity and team spirit sharp.
